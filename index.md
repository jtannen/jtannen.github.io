Hello! I'm a statistician and ML engineer, and a lifelong Philadelphian.

My Ph.D. research focused on spatial processes of neighborhood change. I spend most of my time these days on statistical modeling, bayesian machine learning, GIS, and politics.

I blog about Philadelphia politics at [sixtysixwards.com](https://www.sixtysixwards.com).

At my day job I manage the Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Message Testing team at Blue Rose Research to help Democrats win elections.
