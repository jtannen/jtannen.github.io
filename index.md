Hello! I'm an urban spatial demographer and a lifelong Philadelphian.

My Ph.D. research focused on spatial processes of neighborhood change. I spend most of my time these days on statistical modeling, bayesian machine learning, GIS, and politics.

I blog about Philadelphia politics at [sixtysixwards.com](https://www.sixtysixwards.com).

For work I manage the ML-based Message Testing team at Blue Rose Research helping good candidates win elections.
