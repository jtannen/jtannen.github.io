Hello! I'm a statistician and ML engineer, and a lifelong Philadelphian.

My [Ph.D. research](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01pz50gz56r) focused on spatial processes of neighborhood change.

I spend most of my time these days on statistical modeling, bayesian machine learning, GIS, and politics. I love building statistically rigorous modelling frameworks with scalable high-quality codebases.

I blog about Philadelphia politics at [sixtysixwards.com](sixtysixwards.com).

In 2018, I was a founding researcher on Facebook's Algorithmic Fairness team, and in 2019 created and managed its engineering team.

In 2022, I joined Blue Rose Research to help Democrats win elections. Today, I manage our Heterogeneous Treatment Effects team.
