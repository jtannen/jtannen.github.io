Hello! I'm an urban spatial demographer and a lifelong Philadelphian.

My Ph.D. research focused on spatial processes of neighborhood change.

I spend most of my time these days on statistical modeling, bayesian machine learning, GIS, and politics. I love building statistically rigorous modelling frameworks with scalable high-quality codebases.

I blog about Philadelphia politics at [sixtysixwards.com](sixtysixwards.com).

I was a founding member of Facebook's Algorithmic Fairness team, eventually managing it.

Today I manage the ML-based Message Testing team at Blue Rose Research helping Democrats win elections.
