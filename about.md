Hello! I'm a statistician and ML engineer, and a lifelong Philadelphian.

My [Ph.D. research](http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01pz50gz56r) studied spatial processes of neighborhood change.

These days, I focus on statistical modeling, bayesian machine learning, and GIS. I love building statistically-rigorous modelling frameworks with scalable, high-quality codebases.

I blog about Philadelphia politics at [sixtysixwards.com](sixtysixwards.com).

In 2018, I was a founding researcher on Facebook's Algorithmic Fairness team, and in 2019 created and managed the Algorithmic Fairness Engineering team.

In 2022, I joined Blue Rose Research. Today, I'm a Tech Lead Manager of our Heterogeneous Treatment Effects team.
